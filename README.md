# FirstSetOfExercises
Contains a main method which implements a menu for the user to guide through algorithms concerning

1. Simple algorithms
    > Factorial
    > Prime numbers
    > Max integer for which factorial can be calculated
    > For a given n calculation of: 1 + ½ + ⅓+ ... + 1/n. 
    > Count of digits for a long number
    > Find decimal part of a float number
    
2. Arrays and collections
    > Given a list of integers, returns a sub list that contains only the prime numbers 
    > Implementation of a list eliminating the duplicates from a list.
    > A program that returns the digits of number in descending order.
    > Reverse of a string using only a stack .   
    > Check if a word is symmetric,  ignoring cases.
